Imagine you are that dumbass that thought: "meh i dont need github, ha!" before losing all data...., anyways that dumbass was me, that is why I made this 

This Game is ready for shipping, Steam, Itch.Io, Mobile or any Game Store.It can.... definately be sold with....m...mo...money.... six....ty dollar?? im just kiding this will never see the light of day, but i made the game....so im kinda proud of it, yyyeeeaahhh....cool??? the code is pretty shit tho

The plot revolve around a bad game Dev whose main driving force is to make any playthrough....a living hell, with 10 level and for good mesure he added his soul into the game just because! (hes just that petty )
